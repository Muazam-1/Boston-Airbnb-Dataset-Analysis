**Project Overview:**

While working with the first project of Udacity nano degree program there were few questions that came up in my mind while i was working with the Boston Airbnb Dataset.

1. Number of reviews based on scores.
            
2. Price Based on Neighborhood.
             
3. Reviews based on Neighborhood.
            

            
**The Project Consist of three files i.e; **

1. listings.csv 

2. reviews.csv 

3. calendar.csv.

**Libraries:**

1. Pandas

2. Numpy

3. Seaborn

4. Matplotlib.

**Results:**

1. Reviews having score ≥ 9 have higher count while reviews ≤ 8 have lower count.

2. Places like chestnut hill, Mattapan, Brookline, Somerville have lower rental prices while places like Financial districts and Downtown Crossing have higher rental prices.

3. There is not much of a difference when it comes to the relation between the review scores and different areas of Boston.
